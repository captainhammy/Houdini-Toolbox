"""Create points at the centers of primitives."""

This node creates points at the centers of primitives. These points have
their normal value set to the normal of the source primitive.  Specific
attributes can also be copied.

@parameters
    Method:
	The type of calculation to use when computing the centroid.

	Barycenter:
	    Use the average point position of each point in the primitive.
	Bounding Box:
	    Use the bounding box of the primitive.

    Attributes to Copy:
	Primitive attributes to copy to the center points.

    Copy Local Variables:
        All local variables referring to the copied attributes are also
        copied.
@inputs
Source:
    Primitives to generate centroids for.
