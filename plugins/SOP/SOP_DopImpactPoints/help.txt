"""Generates points based on Impact record data from DOP objects."""

This operation creates points at the location of impacts of DOP objects.  These points can contain
useful data about the collision as well as be filtered based on object ids and collision impulse.

== Using @OP_LABEL@ ==

    # Invoke the [Icon:@help_icon_name@][@OP_LABEL@|Node:@OP_HELP_CONTEXT@/@HELP_NAME@] tool from the __tab__ menu.

    # Select the Dop object(s) to create impact data for and press ((Enter)) to complete.

@parameters
    DOP Network:
        The DOP Network to extract the impact information from.

    Normal:
        The direction of the impact at the point of impact.

    Impulse:
        The intensity of the impact.

    Source ID:
        The object id of the object that is impacting.

    Other Object ID:
        The object id of the object that is being collided against.

    == Number of Configurations ==
        The number of individual configurations to generate points.

        Enable n:
            Controls whether the node uses this line. This can be useful if you only want to temporarily
            disable a merge instead of removing it completely.

        Object Mask:
            Specifies the objects within the DOP Network to extract the impacts from.

        Impact Mask:
            Specifies the objects which the objects in the Object Mask will generate impact points for.

        Impulse Threshold:
            Specifies the minimum impulse value to create impact points. This setting allows for the
            trimming of impacts points once an object has decreased speed or come to rest.
