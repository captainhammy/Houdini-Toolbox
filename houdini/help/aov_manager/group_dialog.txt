NOTE:
    When adding new groups to existing .json files or modifying groups, the
    .json file will be appended to/rewritten in place.  Given the nature of
    json data this may result of the internal order of elements in the file to
    change.

== Creating Groups ==

    To create a new group you must specify a __Group Name__, __File Path__ and
    have at least one member AOV selected.  All other settings are optional and
    will only be written to the definition if the default values are changed.

== Editing Groups ==

    When editing a group you are able to change the group membership, as well
    as any values except the __Group Name__ and __File Path__.  If you wish to
    change these then you must currently modify them manually in the source
    file.

    NOTE:
	Hit the __Reset__ button to revert any changes.

== Deleting Groups ==

    To delete a group definition you must currently remove the definition from 
    the source file.
