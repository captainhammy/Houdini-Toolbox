The __Create/Edit AOV__ dialog is used to create new or modify existing AOVs.

[Image:/images/aov_manager/aov_dialog.png]

NOTE:
    When adding new AOVs to existing .json files or modifying AOVs, the .json
    file will be appended to/rewritten in place.  Given the nature of json
    data this may result of the internal order of elements in the file to
    change.

== Creating AOVs ==

    To create a new AOV you must specify a __VEX Variable__, __VEX Type__, and
    __File Path__.  All other settings are optional and will only be written to
    the definition if the default values are changed.

    NOTE:
	Default values corresponding to internal SOHO default values.


== Editing AOVs ==

    When editing an AOV you are able to change any values except the __VEX
    Variable__, __VEX Type__, and __File Path__.  If you wish to change these
    then you must currently modify them manually in the source file.

    NOTE:
	Hit the __Reset__ button to revert any changes.

== Deleting AOVs ==

    To delete an AOV definition you must currently remove the definition from
    the source file.
